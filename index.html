            <p>&nbsp;<br>Link state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its neighborhood with every other router in the internetwork.

              <br>The three keys to understand the Link State Routing algorithm:
              
              <ul>Knowledge about the neighborhood: Instead of sending its routing table, a router sends the information about its neighborhood only. A router broadcast its identities and cost of the directly attached links to other routers.</ul>
              <ul>Flooding: Each router sends the information to every other router on the internetwork except its neighbors. This process is known as Flooding. Every router that receives the packet sends the copies to all its neighbors. Finally, each and every router receives a copy of the same information.</ul>
              <ul>Information sharing: A router sends the information to every other router only when the change occurs in the information.</ul>&nbsp;</p>
